# Project Title

Blossomio is a gamified pomodoro targeted for individuals with learning disabilities such as ADHD and autism who struggle with engaging in focused studying/working. Creating a gamified element to studying will provide users with fun, study oriented objectives associated with raising a lush, green collection of plants. 


## Lessons Learned

This is a project created by Berkeley freshman for CalHacks 10.0 using HTML, CSS, and JS. Future elements we hope to update are further developing the plant collection game, adding colorblind mode, and incorporation music player.
