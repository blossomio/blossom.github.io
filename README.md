# Blossomio

Blossomio is a gamified pomodoro targeted for individuals with learning disabilities such as ADHD and autism who struggle with engaging in focused studying/working. Creating a gamified element to studying will provide users with fun, study oriented objectives associated with raising a lush, green collection of plants. The more you study with Blossom, the more plants you help 'Blossom'!


## Lessons Learned
